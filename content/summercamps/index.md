Title: "Summer Camps 2023"
---

Atelier Summer Camps are week-long art experiences for children ages 6 to 12. Each summer camp week has a theme, and each class session will include instruction on an art topic, a snack, and time to work on a related project. Campers will complete 4-6 art projects in each camp, and gain valuable skills they can use in their own art at home! Classes are Monday through Friday from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The camps are taught by Sarah Turner, an elementary school teacher, and Jessica Parker, owner of Atelier.

## Women in Art

Let your children be inspired by female artists! We will learn about five famous women artists throughout history, including Frida Kahlo and Georgia O'Keefe, and try out their techniques by creating our own art projects. After discussing and analyzing notable paintings, children will create a fun art piece in the style of the artist they learned about, using materials such as acrylic paint, oil pastels, and watercolor.\

## Elements of Art

This camp is perfect for children who want to learn how to better their artistic abilities. We will be exploring elements of art such as line, color, value, texture, and perspective. Each class session will include a lesson on one of the elements, analyzing notable artwork that exemplifies that element, art drills to improve skill, and time to complete an art piece.\
