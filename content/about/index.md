Atelier (pronounced ah-teel-yay) is the French work for a studio or workshop, and that's exactly what we have here. Atelier is a fully-equipped art studio where kids (and adults!) can work on art projects and learn new art skills.

For more than twenty years, Bev Keyes, a talented artist and teacher, ran Atelier, teaching hundreds of kids how to draw and paint. Through her creativity and love of teaching, she built the studio into a vibrant, rich place where students can explore creativity and improve their drawing ability.

In the spring of 2021, Bev sold the studio to Jessica Parker, one of her former Atelier students. Jessica now teaches the classes, working to uphold the wonderful legacy created by Bev, and to help people feel more confident about their ability to be creative and artistic.

Jessica studied illustration and graphic design at college and graduated from BYU in April of 2020.
