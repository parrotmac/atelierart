## FALL STUDIO CLASSES

The fall all class schedule runs from September through December.

Because Atelier students range in age from elementary school to adult, the class times listed below have recommended age ranges based on the age of students currently attending at each class. These age groups are loose, as some students attend with older siblings or neighbors, or are comfortable being around students of a different age. New students are generally welcome to join any open class time (including ones outside of their age range). If you're not sure what class would be best, I'm more than happy to talk with you and help you find a good fit!

New class slots may be opened or current ones may be closed depending on enrollment.
