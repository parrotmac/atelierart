### STUDIO CLASSES
_Open to ages 7+_

In this class style, students attend in small groups. Each student works on individual projects at their own pace with help from the instructor. They works from photo reference to create a piece of their choosing, and may work with any of the classroom supplies, including watercolor, colored pencil, oil paint, acrylic, pastel, charcoal, graphite, and more. Instructor support will be given when needed. Students work on the piece for as many weeks as they need to finish, and then may start a new piece.

These classes run perpetually, and tuition is paid on a monthly basis. ($85/month)

### OTHER CLASSES

Several other class options, including a shorter-term watercolor basics class, may become available soon. Check back for updates!
