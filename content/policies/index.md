Title: Atelier Policies
---

*Last Updated September 2021*

## **General Policies and Rules**

Here are a few rules that all students need to follow to make sure that art class is a safe and comfortable place for everyone.

The number one rule is to **be respectful**. Please respect others and the studio.

Respect for others:

- Please keep language and conversation topics school-appropriate so everyone can feel welcome in the class.
- Speak kindly to and about others.
- Listen to and follow instructions from the teacher.
- Work on your own artwork, and don’t touch anyone else’s project without their permission.

Respect for the studio and supplies:

- Use art supplies as instructed, and keep them in good condition so others can use them as well.
- Clean up after yourself.

### **Other Policies**

Cell Phones/Technology:

- Cell phones are generally allowed so students can listen to their own music, look up reference photos, or reply to an important message. However, if your phone is keeping you or others from working on art, you will be asked to put it away.
- Students are welcome to bring a laptop or tablet to work on digital art projects.

Food and Drinks:

- Only eat food with clean hands. Do not eat anything that has touched paint or other art supplies.
- Outside food may be brought in if it is not messy or distracting.
- Clean up any messes left behind.

Art Content:

- In general, students can draw or paint whatever subjects interest them. Please be thoughtful in your choices, as other students, parents, and young children visit the studio and may see your artwork. The instructor has the final say on whether a project’s content is appropriate and allowed. Please keep your art subjects family-friendly.

## **Payment**

I am trying some new things with payments for the rest of the year, which should simplify the payment process. From Labor Day to the end of the year is now the **Fall Semester** for art classes. There is now an option to pay for the rest of the year (September-December) all at once, at a discounted rate. Or if you’d prefer, you can continue to pay the normal rate of $85/month.

**Monthly Rate:** $85/month

There is now a calendar for the rest of the year, including days when the studio will be closed for holidays. You can access the calendar **here**.

**Payment is due at the beginning of each month**, or if you pay all at once, at the beginning of the semester. Payments more than a week overdue will incur a $10 late fee. An additional $10 charge will be added to the fee each week that the payment is late. If payment is not received by the end of the month, your student may be dropped from the class.

By signing up for art class, you are reserving a seat during your class’s time slot. Unfortunately, **I cannot offer discounts or refunds for missed weeks of class**. $85 is the flat monthly rate, regardless of the number of weeks in the month when class is held (some months have 5 Mondays, and with breaks, some only have 3, but the price is the same). If you cannot make it to class, please let me know in advance, then you may attend another class time for a make-up lesson, space permitting (generally limited to one make-up class per month).

Exceptions will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

Payment may be made via 1) Venmo, 2) card, 3) cash, or 4) check.

Venmo: **@atelier-art-lessons** or click **[here](/payments/).**

Credit Card: visit the online payment portal [here](/payments/).

Checks can be made out to **Jessica Parker** or to **Atelier Children’s Art Program**

Bring cash in, and I’ll print you a receipt.

## **Studio Safety**

At Atelier, students have the opportunity to use artist-grade (high quality) art supplies. These supplies make it easier to make beautiful art. However, artist-grade art supplies are quite different from the paints made for kids, and need to be used carefully.

### **Potential Hazards**

**All Paint Types (Oil, Watercolor, Acrylic, etc.)**Some of the metals and minerals used in making high-quality paint pigments, such as cadmium, can lead to health problems over years of repeated skin exposure, and can be toxic or otherwise harmful if ingested. The ingredients of other paints, while not necessarily toxic, are not safe to eat.

**Specific Oil Painting Concerns:**Oil paint is not water-soluble, so brushes must be cleaned with a paint thinner, such as turpentine or mineral spirits. To change the consistency or flow of oil paints, oil painting mediums (aka “glaze”) may be used. The paint thinner and many kinds of oil painting mediums are flammable and toxic if ingested. Their fumes can make you sick, causing dizziness or headaches, and they can be absorbed by your body through skin contact, causing irritation or lasting damage.

**Other Art Supplies:**Chalk pastels and charcoal produce a lot of dust, which can cause lung irritation if inhaled. Glues, fixatives, and other various art supplies can irritate skin or release harmful fumes.

### **Staying Safe in the Studio**

All of the art supplies in the studio can be used safely, as long as the risks are understood and proper precautions are taken.

I will do my best to ensure studio safety by providing paints that include the least harmful ingredients, and high-quality odorless mineral spirits and mediums, which minimize the danger for oil painting. I will ensure that the HVAC system is on, allowing for airflow in the space. Additionally, I will provide training and guidance so students understand the proper use of each supply. Despite my efforts, there are elements of painting that remain hazardous if students don’t comply with safety regulations.

In order for students to be able to use the art supplies, especially paint, the following rules must be followed at all times. Failure to comply with these safety regulations will result in the student no longer being allowed to use the supply.

- Do not eat or drink (or pretend you’re going to eat/drink) paint, painting mediums or glazes, paint thinners, water for cleaning brushes, or any other art supply.
- Do not eat food that has touched paint, glazes, or paint thinner. Make sure your hands are clean before eating.
- Do not purposely put paint on your skin or on other people. (Paint does tend to get on lots of surfaces and it’s easy to accidentally get paint on your arm. Just don’t do it on purpose.)
- Don’t touch the paint thinner (“turp”) with your bare hands.
- Follow instructions on the proper use of each art supply.
- Wash hands thoroughly after painting.

Please note that due to the additional risks presented by oil painting supplies, oil paint will not be offered as an option for kids 10 and under. If they want a similar look for a painting, acrylic paint can be used.
